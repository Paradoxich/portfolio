          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            Neptune didn’t arrive as a clear brief. It arrived as a vibe.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            Half “AI platform engineer,” half “agentic infra copilot,” and a little bit “Shuttle’s cousin who spent too much time around LLMs.” The team knew the problem was real — the gap between AI-generated code and actual deployment.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            Neptune kept changing shape — part CLI, part agent, sometimes both. I built a brand and landing page that could keep up.

      {/* 2. USERS & DISCOVERY */}

            AI-native users, not "traditional devs"
          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            Before we designed anything, we listened. Three key insights emerged:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 stack-xs type-body">
            <li>
              Users already lived inside AI tools — Cursor, Copilot, Claude Projects, and agent workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
              They trusted AI to write code but hesitated to trust it with deployment. Infra felt spooky.
            </li>
            <li>
              They wanted an AI engineer with guardrails — power combined with clarity and automation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="type-body">
            Neptune’s personality landed as calm, precise, and quietly smart — a deliberate contrast to hype-driven AI branding.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* 3. PRODUCT FUZZINESS */}
      <section className="stack-md">
        <div className="text-column stack-md">
          <h3 className="type-h4">
            Making sense of a moving target
          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            As the team refined what Neptune should be, the real question wasn’t “console or IDE?” — it was how much UI it needed at all.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            Neptune is a hybrid: you install a CLI, but most interaction flows through natural language in your IDE agent. Some commands return simple output; others write new files directly into your project — generating the agent file, adding infra specs, wiring services.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            My work had to support that ambiguity. I focused on brand positioning and landing page design that stayed coherent whether Neptune showed up as a light-touch agent, a richer console, or something between.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* 4. VISUAL DIRECTION */}
      <section className="stack-md">
        <div className="text-column stack-md">
          <h3 className="type-h4">
            Making infra feel human
          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            The landing page became our first real artifact, because Neptune is hard to explain without drifting into sci-fi. We needed to talk about agentic workflows, infra wiring, and code-to-cloud automation without turning it into a space opera.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            So the starting point wasn’t visuals — it was a flexible layout we could use to test messaging, tone, and structure together. While the team refined the story, I explored visual directions inside that framework: different backdrops, glow levels, orbit patterns, and how much “AI energy” felt right before things tipped into chaos.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            The final aesthetic hits the balance we wanted: dark but not dramatic, technical but not neon-matrix. Clean typography, measured spacing, subtle gradients, and small pulses of color that act like signals rather than decoration. Orbit graphics help communicate how Neptune connects things behind the scenes, while the restrained palette keeps the page calm and confident.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            It’s a visual language that makes complex infra feel surprisingly understandable — modern, trustworthy, and quietly powerful.
          </p>

      </section>


      {/* 6. NATURE OF THE WORK */}

            How we actually worked together
          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            This wasn’t a “give me three logo options by Friday” assignment. It was a moving mix of positioning, messaging, early brand direction, visual exploration, landing page design, and constant reframing as the product evolved.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            I collaborated closely with the team, and we were shaping the brief as much as the brand. Design wasn’t just decorating the product; it was helping define how Neptune thinks and speaks.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* 7. OUTCOME */}
      <section className="stack-md">
        <div className="text-column stack-md">
          <h3 className="type-h4">
            A foundation for whatever Neptune becomes next
          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            Neptune now has:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 stack-xs type-body">
            <li>a clear identity tailored for AI-assisted developers</li>
            <li>positioning that withstands product pivots</li>
            <li>a visual direction grounded in engineering clarity</li>
            <li>a landing page that explains the concept without hype</li>
            <li>alignment across the team on tone, audience, and personality</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="type-body">
            The work turned a fuzzy idea into something structured and communicable — a platform that finally sounds like it knows what it wants to be, even if it’s still evolving behind the scenes.
