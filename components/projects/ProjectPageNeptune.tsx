          <p className="type-body">
            Neptune didn&apos;t arrive as a clear brief. It arrived as a vibe.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            Half &quot;AI platform engineer,&quot; half &quot;agentic infra
            copilot,&quot; and a little bit &quot;Shuttle&apos;s cousin who
            spent too much time around LLMs.&quot; The team knew they were
            solving something real — the gap between AI-generated code and
            actual deployment — but the product itself was shifting every week.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            Some days Neptune was a console. Some days an IDE agent. Some days a
            CLI. Some days… all three. My job was to build a brand and narrative
            that could survive this identity crisis.

            AI-native users, not &quot;traditional devs&quot;
          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            Before touching visuals, we did discovery work. And immediately,
            three truths showed up:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 type-body">
            <li>
              Users were already living in AI tools — Cursor, Copilot, Claude
              Projects, agent workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
              They trusted AI to write code, but not to deploy it. Infra was the
              spooky part.
            </li>
            <li>
              They wanted an AI engineer, not an AI chaos gremlin — power with
              guardrails, automation with clarity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="type-body">
            That&apos;s where Neptune&apos;s personality landed:
            <br />
            <span className="text-color-text-primary">
              calm, precise, quietly smart — the opposite of hype-drunk AI
              branding.

            Branding something that kept changing
          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            This project was… fluid. One week the team said, &quot;There&apos;s
            no console.&quot; Two weeks later: &quot;Okay, so here&apos;s the
            console.&quot; Then: &quot;Actually the IDE agent is the primary
            flow.&quot; Then: &quot;But what if infra was invisible?&quot; Then:
            &quot;But also visual?&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            My work had to flex with the product without losing coherence. The
            approach: create positioning and a design language that made sense
            whether Neptune lived in the IDE, terminal, or browser. The
            personality stayed stable even while features shape-shifted.

      {/* 4. VISUAL DIRECTION */}

          <p className="type-body">
            Once the strategy clicked, I explored an aesthetic that felt:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 type-body">
            <li>dark but not dystopian</li>

            <li>elegant, precise type with soft glow accents</li>
            <li>
              structured layouts with a sense of engineered calm instead of
              visual noise
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="type-body">
            Basically: &quot;AI-native… but also trustworthy.&quot; It needed to
            sit next to Shuttle, not mimic it.

            Website &amp; storytelling — simplifying the abstract
          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            The landing page became the first real artifact. Neptune had to be
            explained without overpromising things still in development (or
            still being debated).
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            The narrative focused on who it&apos;s for, the real problem AI devs
            feel, how Neptune connects AI-written code to real cloud infra, why
            transparency and guardrails matter, and what an &quot;agentic
            workflow&quot; means without sounding like sci-fi.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            A lot of my work was translating extremely technical conversations
            into language that feels calm, clear, and human.

            The messy, collaborative nature of the project

          <p className="type-body">
            This wasn&apos;t a &quot;give me three logo options by Friday&quot;
            assignment. It was a moving mix of positioning, messaging, early
            brand direction, visual exploration, landing page design, and
            ongoing reframing as the product evolved.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            I collaborated closely with the team — especially product — and we
            were shaping the brief as much as the brand. Design wasn&apos;t just
            decorating the product; it was helping define how Neptune thinks and
            speaks.

            Outcome — coherence for something still becoming
          </h3>
          <p className="type-body">
            Neptune now has a clear identity for AI-assisted developers, a
            positioning that survives product pivots, and a visual direction
            rooted in engineering clarity.
          </p>
          <p className="type-body">
            The landing page explains the concept without hype, and the team is
            aligned on tone, audience, and personality. The work turned a fuzzy
            idea into something structured and communicable — a platform that
            finally sounds like it knows what it wants to be (even if it&apos;s
            still evolving behind the scenes).
